    "* Recursive: of, relating to, or constituting a procedure that can repeat itself indefinitely\n",
    "* Recursion: a repeated application of a recursive procedure or definition.('recursion',from late Latin word 'recurrere' which means '**run back**')\n",
    "* Tactic: divide a problem into sub-problems of the same type as the original (Divide-and-Conquer Method)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Principles\n",
    "## Recursive functions in programming:\n",
    "* Base case: There must be one or more base cases in recursive functions. In base case, the function produces a result trivially.\n",
    "* Make progress: The program recurs to get solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. In a well-defined function, the base case must be reached eventually.\n",
    "* Always believe: Always assume the recursive call works.\n",
    "* Compound interest rule: Never duplicate work by solving the same instance of a problem in separate recursive calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recursively defined functions in mathematics:\n",
    "* Basis step: Specify the value of the function at zero.\n",
    "* Recursive step: Give the rules for finding its value at an integer from its value at smaller integers.\n",
